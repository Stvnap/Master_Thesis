Current tasks:

Check Dataset_preprocessing.py for logic errors
  optional: Clean up code and envelope everything in functions; CHECK, see v2

Write code for DNN_pipeline.py to allow the first training in a simple linear DNN with no hyperparameter scanning; CHECK

Check for data leakage; loss & accuracy are way to high to be right (Epoch 1 = acc: 0.9951, loss 0.0534)
	possible solitions: only apply the sliding window function to the train set, not val & test set?
